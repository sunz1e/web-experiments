            Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte;[1][b] 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal
            name Napoleon I, was a French emperor and military commander who rose to prominence during the French
            Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the leader of the French
            Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804
            until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and
            controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian
            rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are
            still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for
            the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died.[2][3]

            Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica into a family descending from Italian nobility.[4][5] He was
            resentful of the French monarchy, and supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French
            army, trying to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the ranks after saving the
            governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against
            the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories, and became a national hero. Two years
            later he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a
            coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. In 1804, to consolidate and expand his power,
            he crowned himself Emperor of the French.

            Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon
            shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to
            the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon
            defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and
            defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to
            accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of
            the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.

            Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula
            and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the
            Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an
            invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of
            Napoleon's Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against
            France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition
            invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island
            of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.

            Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh
            Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the
            remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51.

            Napoleon had a lasting impact on the world, bringing modernizing reforms to France and Western Europe[c] and
            stimulating the development of nation states. He also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in
            1803, doubling the size of the United States.[2][13] However, his exploitation of conquered territories,
            mixed record on civil rights, reintroduction of slavery in France's colonies, and repression of the Haitian
            Revolution are controversial and adversely affect his reputation.[14]

            invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of
            Napoleon's Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against
            France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition
            invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island
            of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.

            Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh
            Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the
            remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51.

            Napoleon had a lasting impact on the world, bringing modernizing reforms to France and Western Europe[c] and
            stimulating the development of nation states. He also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in
            1803, doubling the size of the United States.[2][13] However, his exploitation of conquered territories,
            mixed record on civil rights, reintroduction of slavery in France's colonies, and repression of the Haitian
            Revolution are controversial and adversely affect his reputation.[14]
            Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte;[1][b] 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal
            name Napoleon I, was a French emperor and military commander who rose to prominence during the French
            Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the leader of the French
            Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804
            until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and
            controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian
            rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are
            still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for
            the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died.[2][3]

            Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica into a family descending from Italian nobility.[4][5] He was
            resentful of the French monarchy, and supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French
            army, trying to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the ranks after saving the
            governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against
            the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories, and became a national hero. Two years
            later he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a
            coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. In 1804, to consolidate and expand his power,
            he crowned himself Emperor of the French.

            Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon
            shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to
            the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon
            defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and
            defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to
            accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of
            the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.

            Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula
            and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the
            Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an

            the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon
            defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and
            defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to
            accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of
            the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.

            Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula
            and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the
            Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an
            invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of
            Napoleon's Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against
            France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition
            invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island
            of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.

            Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh
            Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the
            remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51.

            Napoleon had a lasting impact on the world, bringing modernizing reforms to France and Western Europe[c] and
            stimulating the development of nation states. He also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in
            1803, doubling the size of the United States.[2][13] However, his exploitation of conquered territories,
            mixed record on civil rights, reintroduction of slavery in France's colonies, and repression of the Haitian
            Revolution are controversial and adversely affect his reputation.[14]
            Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte;[1][b] 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal
            name Napoleon I, was a French emperor and military commander who rose to prominence during the French
            Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the leader of the French
            Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804
            until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and
            controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian
            rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are
            still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for
            the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died.[2][3]

            Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica into a family descending from Italian nobility.[4][5] He was
            resentful of the French monarchy, and supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French
            army, trying to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the ranks after saving the
            governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against
            the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories, and became a national hero. Two years
            later he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a
            coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. In 1804, to consolidate and expand his power,
            he crowned himself Emperor of the French.

            army, trying to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the ranks after saving the
            governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against
            the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories, and became a national hero. Two years
            later he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a
            coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. In 1804, to consolidate and expand his power,
            he crowned himself Emperor of the French.

            Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon
            shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to
            the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon
            defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and
            defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to
            accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of
            the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.

            Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula
            and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the
            Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an
            invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of
            Napoleon's Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against
            France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition
            invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island
            of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.

            Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh
            Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the
            remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51.

            Napoleon had a lasting impact on the world, bringing modernizing reforms to France and Western Europe[c] and
            stimulating the development of nation states. He also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in
            1803, doubling the size of the United States.[2][13] However, his exploitation of conquered territories,
            mixed record on civil rights, reintroduction of slavery in France's colonies, and repression of the Haitian
            Revolution are controversial and adversely affect his reputation.[14]
            Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte;[1][b] 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal
            name Napoleon I, was a French emperor and military commander who rose to prominence during the French
            Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the leader of the French
            Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804
            until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and
            controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian
            rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are
            still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for
            the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died.[2][3]
